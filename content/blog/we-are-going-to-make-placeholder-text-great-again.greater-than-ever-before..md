I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.

When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.

Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive.
